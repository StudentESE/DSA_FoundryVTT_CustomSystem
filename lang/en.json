    "CONDITIONDESCRIPTION": {
        "encumbered": "Heavy gear and armor can weigh heroes down, restricting their mobility. Encumbered characters suffer penalties to applicable skill checks, based on their current level of Encumbrance. Applicable skills are indicated as such in their descriptions. When heroes discard weight, their levels of Encumbrance go away. When calculating encumbrance due to load, remember to ignore the weight of the hero’s armor, which is already factored into its Encumbrance value.",
        "stunned": "Whether from wine, drugs, exhaustion, or a good brawl, a hero might gain levels of Stupor and suffer disorientation and lethargy. However, the effects of Stupor do not last very long. Remove 1 level of Stupor for every 3 full hours of rest, unless directed otherwise.",
        "raptured": "When Blessed Ones use large numbers of karma points (KP) within a short period of time, they acquire a condition called Rapture. Every passing hour reduces Rapture levels by 1.",
        "feared": "Terribly monstrous creatures, certain magical spells, and the disadvantage Fear of… can all induce Fear. Creatures react to fear in very different ways. Some won't let the cause of their panic out of their sight, others try to back away or even flee, and still others clumsily try to get rid of the cause. Catatonia is an example of a very strong reaction. The negative effects of this condition persist as long as the cause remains close by. When the cause is removed, Fear lowers by 1 level every 5 minutes, unless stated otherwise.",
        "paralysed": "Whether from a ghoul’s attack, a Paralysis spell, or pure terror, you might someday find yourself unable to move. As the condition Paralysis takes hold, your limbs and tongue grow stiff until, in the worst cases, the entire body becomes unresponsive. The victim remains conscious and able to breathe, but cannot act. Unless directed otherwise, remove one level of Paralysis every hour.",
        "inpain": "Wounds, poison, magical spells, and other troubles might cause heroes Pain, which in the worst cases leaves them incapacitated as well. Heroes can suffer from this condition simply from losing life points (LP), and gain a level of Pain every time their LP drop by 25% of the total amount. Thus, a hero gains a level of Pain at 75% LP, a second level at 50%, and a third at 25%. Heroes gain the fourth level of Pain when their LP drop to 5 or lower. To remain active when suffering 4 levels of Pain, the character must make a Self-Control (Stay Conscious) check with a penalty of –4. When healing, one level of Pain goes away every time a hero’s LP rise back above these benchmarks (5 LP, 25%, 50%, and 75%). ",
        "confused": "Certain drugs, poisons, injuries, illnesses, spells, demonic powers, and even a creature called the ikanaria butterfly can all influence a hero’s mind and cause the condition Confused. The duration for this condition is given in the description of the respective cause. Remove one level of Confusion every hour, unless directed otherwise.",
        "unconscious": "A sleeping character is considered unconscious, and a hero who suffers a massive blow to the head might be rendered unconscious as well. Even though the body remains functional, the character’s mind is either distracted, seemingly inactive, or otherwise unresponsive. In short, all the lights are out. Furthermore, an unconscious hero is incapacitated.",
        "blind": "A blind person cannot see, whether due to the Blind disadvantage, total darkness, or even a simple blindfold. How well blind characters orient depends on their other senses. Even the simplest actions might require a skill check on Perception. Some skills are impossible for blind heroes to use, while other skills suffer large penalties. The GM decides which skills belong in these categories, and the degree of penalty, based on the situation. For example, a blind hero may be able to discern an enemy’s position during combat if the enemy makes a lot of noise. This might require checks on Perception (Search) vs. Stealth (Sneak). Blind heroes that hear their foes in this manner can still fight, but with the following restrictions. • Blind heroes make all close combat attacks at half the normal close combat Attack value • Ranged combat becomes a game of pure chance, requiring a roll of 1 on 1D20 to hit • Parries are as difficult to perform as ranged attacks, also requiring a roll of 1 on 1D20 to succeed • Dodging an incoming ranged attack is impossible while blind • Blind characters must touch opponents in order to affect them with spells or liturgical chants",
        "bloodrush": "Starting on the next combat round after entering this state, a hero gains a +4 bonus to attacks, a +2 bonus to damage, and a +2 bonus to Feat of Strength checks. In addition, the hero ignores the effects of the condition Pain. However, the hero may no longer defend, engage in ranged combat, use skills other than physical skills and Intimidation, or use special combat abilities other than Forceful Blow. The GM secretly rolls 2D20 to determine the duration of the bloodlust in combat rounds. During this time the hero attacks enemies, but when all enemies are disabled, the hero attacks the next closest person, be it a friend, an innocent bystander, a city guard, or even the Empress Rohaja herself. If no one is near, the hero goes on a rampage in search of targets. When bloodlust ends, the character gains 2 levels of the condition Stupor.",
        "burning": "The hero’s clothing catches fire, and the hero suffers fire damage as long as this state remains in effect. Extinguishing a burning character requires a check on Body Control. Rolls to put out small fires have no modifier, while bigger fires incur a –1 penalty, and extinguishing a person who is completely aflame suffers a –2 penalty. You may roll to extinguish a burning character once every combat round. Others may help in the effort to extinguish the flames, making checks on Body Control, but each may make only one roll per combat round. Water, sand, and other aids may grant a bonus to the check. The GM decides whether a hero must make a skill check to pour a bucket of water over a burning character. These rules also apply for heroes that are attacked by or covered in acid, although neutralizing acid requires a huge amount of water or other suitable substance. Without such a substance, no skill check is allowed.",
        "constricted": "Characters in exceedingly small, narrow, or tight places are cramped. Even finding oneself in the midst of a large crowd can trigger this state. A cramped hero can barely move and suffers penalties for weapon and shield use in combat situations. Short weapons suffer no penalties. Attacks and parries with medium weapons suffer a – 4 penalty, while attacks and parries with long weapons suffer a –8 penalty. Checks for other skills may suffer a penalty of up to –2, at the GM’s discretion. Spells and liturgical chants suffer no penalties for casting while cramped.",
        "prone": "Whether just waking up or finding oneself knocked down, a prone person is one who is lying horizontally on the ground. Being prone is risky, especially in combat situations. As long as this state persists, prone characters have MOV 1 and suffer penalties of –4 to attack and –2 to defense. Standing up takes 1 action. An enemy in close combat range may choose to attack a prone character with an attack of opportunity. To evade this attack of opportunity, the hero must make a check on Body Control (Combat Maneuvers).",
        "invisible": "The hero cannot be seen. However, the character has not vanished into thin air and can still be heard, smelled, and touched. You may attack an invisible character only if you are aware of the character’s presence and approximate location. To locate an invisible character, make a competitive skill check on Perception (Search) vs. Stealth (Sneak). If successful, you may attack (and defend against) the invisible character with the following restrictions. Your attack values are halved, and ranged combat is much harder (roll a 1 on 1D20 to succeed), as is a successful defense (again, roll a 1 on 1D20). You may not defend against an invisible character’s ranged attacks. Characters must touch invisible opponents to affect them with spells or liturgical chants.",
        "incapacitated": "Incapacitated characters can no longer act due to a condition, state, or other influence, or any combination thereof. These characters have MOV 0, cannot act or defend, and are probably rendered prone. Depending on the situation, the GM may allow such characters to use free actions to speak.",
        "rooted": "Paralysis, quicksand, or strong bindings can immobilize characters completely. Immobilized characters cannot move, but can still perceive their surroundings and do anything that does not require much physical activity, such as using most types of lore skills, or casting spells or liturgical chants without gestures.",
        "mute": "A mute person cannot speak. Besides possibly hindering communication, this might also affect the casting of spells or liturgical chants.",
        "deaf": "Deaf heroes cannot hear, hindering communication. Furthermore, they are not allowed to roll skill checks on Perception that depend upon hearing. Checks on Perception (Detect Ambush) suffer a –3 penalty",
        "sick": "A hero suffering from a disease or serius illness cannot regenerate LP or benefit from regular Regeneration Phases until healed or recovered. Heroes suffering from a state of diseased must devote at least one Regeneration Phase per day to rest (sleeping or staying in bed) or lose 1D3 LP (ignoring Protection) until recovered.",
        "surprised": "People are usually considered to be aware of their surroundings, especially in combat situations. Sometimes, however, a situation arises where a character remains unaware of enemies lurking nearby. Surprise means a hero is startled by an ambush or the sudden appearance of enemies. Surprised characters cannot defend against the first action taken against them. Once this surprise action (most likely an attack) is resolved, regular combat rounds begin.",
        "poisoned": "The hero is poisoned. As long as the poison remains in effect, the character cannot benefit from Regeneration Phases.",
        "fixated": "Bound characters are glued to the ground or otherwise held down by ropes, vines or traps. While bound characters have a MOV of 0 and suffer a -4 penalty to Dodge."
